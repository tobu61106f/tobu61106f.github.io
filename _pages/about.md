Welcome! I'm an undergraduate student at [The State University of New York at Buffalo](https://buffalo.edu) studying Electrical Engineering and Mathematics. I'm currently in my fourth years of Undergraduate studies at [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://engineering.buffalo.edu/). I'm currently busy with my senior year capstone project and our teams goal is to develop an infrared detection drone-bot which may give you a similar looks to the detective drone in the game of Rainbow Six: Siege using Buffalo Bytes as a platform. 

Check out my [resume](https://github.com/tobu61106f/ZhiyunYu-CV/blob/main/resume.pdf) for more information on me.
