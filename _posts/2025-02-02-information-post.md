This is the second time I've set up an academic page on GitHub. My first attempt was maded during my undergrad freshman year summer, but unfortunately I ended up by deleting it after less than three months. Now, I'm only just getting familiar with front-end deployment and coding under the Jekyll framework, so let's see how long I can stick with it for this time around.

Other news, I recently took another trip to Japan last month. I visited Osaka, Tokyo, Minami-Otari, Nagano and Shikoku, it was an incredible experience. One of the highlights was riding the Anpanman (アンパンマン) limited express train again after not being there for two years. The nostalgic feeling of the diesel smell from the 2700 series DMU powered gas brought me back to my childhood memories of my hometown. There's something uniquely comforting about that scent, evoking a sense of warmth and familiarity that I deeply cherish.
